##The premise

We're survivors of a crashed spaceship, factorio style?
  We want to escape from this planet 
  If one of us is doing a task, the other one can be "of gathering materials or expanding the factory"
  Use screenshots from factorio to show progress on our escape

We have lots and lots of pens and paper, and lots of tiny robots who can do calculations by hand for us.

The library somehow survived the crash

Cite the work of great physicist like Kep-Ler and such
